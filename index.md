Loom is a file format designed to store and work with single-cell RNA-seq data. Loom can also be used more generally for any type of omics data that is naturally represented as a matrix.

Key features:

* Single file that can be moved around
* Keep metadata with expression data
* Data, clustering, layout, annotation stored together
* Efficient random access
* Automatic, on-the-fly compression
* Any programming language
* First-class Python API
* Out-of-memory data processing
* Open source, BSD license

To get started, head over to the [docs](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy)

Source code is available at GitHub for [loompy](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/loompy) and [loom-viewer](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/loom-viewer).

### Other implementations 

[LoomR](https://github.com/mojaveazure/loomR>) from Rahul Satija's lab implements loom for R

[scanpy](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy) from Fabian Theis lab reads and
writes loom files directly.
